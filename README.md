# Personal Finance Dashboard 

The goal of this Personal Finance Dashboard is to have a better understanding of spending habits and predict future spending on a monthly basis. As a result, the aim of this spending insight is to have more realistic budgets and reduce spending where possible.

## Background Info

I have created a Python based web application dashboard on Flask to gain better insight of my spending habits. This web app is using personal spending data that I have collected for 9 months to analyze and visualize spending patterns, as well as predict future spending. This dashboard connects to a backend database in Postgres which manages historical and new inputted data. As well it predicts average spending per month, based on a time series Prophet model, which allows the user to know if their spending is getting too high.   

## How it Works 
Step 1: Create database called spending_data in Postgres 
Step 2: Run db_script.py to load data into database (csvs must be in same path). This creates the historical records database
Step 3: Run app.py and run on localhost web path to view dashboard
